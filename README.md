# Timesuck 

Are you spending too much time on the computer? Find out with Timesuck. 

Timesuck logs your

- computer usage
- application usage
- website usage (via browser extensions)

## Aren't there better solutions available?

Almost all existing solutions send data back to an external website (I'm looking at you RescueTime). 

Timesuck stores all data locally in a SQLite3 database. No data is ever sent to 3rd party servers.

## Download

- [Timesuck for OS X](https://github.com/downloads/kyleconroy/timesuck/Timesuck.zip)

## Browser Extensions

- [Timesuck for Chrome](https://github.com/downloads/kyleconroy/timesuck/timesuck_chrome_v0.1.crx)

## How do I see my usage?

Install the included python command line tool

    $ pip install timesuck 

or if you don't have `pip`

    $ easy_install timesuck

Now with the tool installed

    $ timesuck

which will show you your usage report for the day, which will look something like this
